# jpp1_1_4
A simple application created to learn how Java, MySQL, JDBC works. In the Util class, I establish a connection to the database. In dao, there is direct work with the database (deleting records, creating a table, etc.). The Services class is used as a layer with business logic (I don't have it yet). Main executes methods of the Services class for an example of how my application works with a database. If you use it in your project, in the Util class, change the lines with URL and others for your database.
